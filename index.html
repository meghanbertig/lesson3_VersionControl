            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control allows for users of a program to modify and edit a program without losing previous versions of the program. There are a few main types of version controls, including Local Version Control Systems, Centralized Version Control Systems, and Distributed Version Control Systems. Local Version Control Systems are easy to use but can result in many errors. Centralized Version Control Systems allow for shared use, as clients can check out files from a main server. However, the most reliable and resourceful version control system is the Distributed Version Control System. It provides “snapshots” every time a file is saved and provides full backup.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are extremely beneficial to professionals, students, teams, and anyone else who wants a secure way to save files! There are many benefits that come with using version control systems. Included in this is that files cannot be overwritten, the common repository holds all the latest files, people can work on a project simultaneously and you can revert or refer back to older files. This can prevent errors in the workplace and in personal life. For example, if one person were to accidentally delete a file on their computer, they can simply retrieve the original file from the version control system. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Although Git is similar to other VCS, there are definitely some differences between them. Many other VCS systems store changes as a file-based change. Git uses “snap shots” of the data, so every time you save a program a different version is saved . This allows people to be able to look at time stamps on programs and realize which file is the most recent, which file is the most relevant, and which file is most useful. All of these versions are linked together as snapshots of data over time. VCSs are much more simple and much less powerful than Git.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Changes to a Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Working directories take on two states: tracked or untracked. Git knows about tracked files and allows you to keep them as unmodified, modified, or staged. An untracked file is a file that was not in a snapshot or in the staging area. Once you start editing, Git notices this and will then go on to classify it as untracked, unmodified, modified, or staged. Adding a file moves it from untracked to staged. Editing a file moves it from unmodified to modified. Staging the file moves it from modified to staged. Removing the file changes it from unmodified to untracked. And committing the file moves it from staged to unmodified.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Some of the basic commands for git include the following set of statements. git status checks the state your file is in. git log shows commit logs. git commit saves changes to local repository. git add adds a change in the working directory. git init creates an empty Git repository. Along with basic commands there are also remote commands. Remote commands include git remote , which manages a set of tracked repositories. git pull, which fetches from and integrates with another repository or local branch.  git push updates remote refs along with associated objects.</p>
